## Development setup

You need NodeJS and yarn.


### Build

Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

Make some changes, run `yarn run test` to run both tslint and karma tests.

Package the library with `yarn run build`.

### Set NPM to use the cloned project


This will do a symbolic link from the global `node_modules` version to point to this folder.
